      title: "About Cornflower Blue Sapphire",
      paragraphs: [
        "Cornflower Blue Sapphire is blue sapphire, the blue variety of corundum, whose colour resembles the cornflower: a vivid but softly toned blue, often with a velvety appearance.",

        "The name is a trade colour term rather than a separate species. The shade has long been associated with Kashmir and with fine stones from Sri Lanka and other sources, although colour alone does not determine origin.",

        "The appearance and value of Cornflower Blue Sapphire depend on several characteristics, including colour, clarity, cut, carat weight, origin, treatment, and overall quality.",
      ],
    },

    BENEFITS: {
      title: "Benefits of Cornflower Blue Sapphire",
      paragraphs: [
        "In traditional Vedic astrology, Blue Sapphire or Neelam is associated with Saturn or Shani. Traditional guidance often advises consulting a qualified astrologer before wearing it. These associations are matters of belief and tradition, not guaranteed outcomes.",

        "Sapphire is a variety of corundum with a Mohs hardness of 9, one of the hardest natural gemstones, and is excellent for rings and everyday wear.",

        "Astrological and metaphysical effects are matters of traditional belief and personal faith. They should not be considered guaranteed outcomes or substitutes for professional advice.",
      ],
    },

    "WHO SHOULD WEAR": {
      title: "Who Should Wear Cornflower Blue Sapphire?",
      paragraphs: [
        "Anyone who appreciates the colour and character of Cornflower Blue Sapphire may choose it as fine jewellery.",

        "Where a gemstone is chosen for astrological reasons, traditional practice is to have the individual birth chart examined by a qualified astrologer, since suitability can vary from person to person.",

        "For jewellery purposes, anyone who appreciates the look and character of Cornflower Blue Sapphire may choose it without wearing it for astrological reasons.",
      ],
    },

    "HOW TO WEAR": {
      title: "How to Wear Cornflower Blue Sapphire",
      paragraphs: [
        "Cornflower Blue Sapphire is commonly set in rings, pendants, earrings and bracelets in gold, silver or platinum, depending on the design. A secure setting protects the stone while allowing light to reach it.",

        "For astrological use, traditional practices may specify the metal, finger, day, and method of wearing a gemstone. These recommendations vary with the individual's birth chart and astrological tradition.",

        "If you are purchasing Cornflower Blue Sapphire specifically for astrological purposes, it is advisable to follow the guidance of a qualified practitioner rather than relying on a general recommendation.",
      ],
    },

    "QUALITY FACTORS": {
      title: "Cornflower Blue Sapphire Quality Factors",
      paragraphs: [
        "The ideal shade is a medium, vivid blue with a soft, velvety glow and without heavy grey or violet tones. Saturation and luminosity matter more than depth of tone.",

        "Natural sapphire commonly contains some inclusions, and eye-clean stones are more valuable. A well-proportioned cut that returns light evenly is important for brilliance.",

        "Heat treatment is widely used on sapphire and accepted in the trade when disclosed. Unheated stones, notable origin and larger carat weight can substantially raise value.",
      ],
    },

    "CARE & CLEANING": {
      title: "Cornflower Blue Sapphire Care & Cleaning",
      paragraphs: [
        "Sapphire is tough and suited to regular wear. Clean with lukewarm water, mild soap and a soft brush, rinse thoroughly and dry with a soft cloth. Stones that are fracture-filled or diffusion-treated need extra care, so follow the seller's guidance.",

        "When not being worn, store Cornflower Blue Sapphire jewellery separately in a soft pouch to reduce the possibility of scratches or damage to other pieces. Periodic checks of the setting by a jeweller are also advisable.",

        "If the stone has undergone any treatment, follow the specific care recommendations provided by the seller or a gemological professional.",
      ],
    },

    "PRICE GUIDE": {
      title: "Cornflower Blue Sapphire Price Guide",
      paragraphs: [
        "Fine cornflower blue sapphires are highly valued, especially when unheated and accompanied by a laboratory report. Prices vary widely with colour, clarity, size, origin and treatment.",

        "There is no single fixed price for Cornflower Blue Sapphire. When comparing prices, compare stones with similar characteristics, treatment status and certification.",

        "A very low price should be evaluated carefully, particularly when the gemstone is claimed to be natural, untreated, or from a specific origin.",
      ],
    },

    "BUYER BEWARE": {
      title: "Cornflower Blue Sapphire Buyer Beware",
      paragraphs: [
        "Cornflower Blue is a descriptive term and not a certified grade. Ask for a laboratory report confirming that the stone is natural sapphire and stating any treatment, and be cautious of origin claims made without documentation.",

        "A reputable seller should be able to explain the gemstone's treatment status and provide appropriate documentation or certification when available.",

        "Be careful with unsupported claims about guaranteed astrological results, extremely rare origins, or unusually high value. A professional gemological report can provide useful information about identity and characteristics.",

        "What is Cornflower Blue Sapphire? Cornflower Blue describes a medium, vivid and softly toned blue reminiscent of the cornflower, valued for its gentle, luminous appearance.",

        "Is Cornflower Blue Sapphire associated with any planet in astrology? In traditional Vedic astrology, Blue Sapphire or Neelam is associated with Saturn or Shani.

        "Is Cornflower Blue a separate gemstone? No. It is a trade term for a particular shade of blue sapphire, not a different species.",

        "Does cornflower blue always mean Kashmir? No. The colour is associated with Kashmir, but similar stones occur elsewhere, and only a laboratory can give an opinion on origin.",

        "How can I verify Cornflower Blue Sapphire? A reputable gemological laboratory certificate can help identify the gemstone and provide information about characteristics such as whether it is natural or synthetic and whether treatment has been detected.",
