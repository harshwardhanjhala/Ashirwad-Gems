      title: "About White Sapphire",
      paragraphs: [
        "White Sapphire is colourless or near-colourless corundum. It contains no strong colouring elements and is valued for its clean, bright look.",

        "It occurs in sources such as Sri Lanka and Madagascar, among others. Its brilliance is lower than that of diamond because of its lower refractive index, but it offers a clear and elegant appearance at a much more accessible price.",

        "The appearance and value of White Sapphire depend on several characteristics, including colour, clarity, cut, carat weight, origin, treatment, and overall quality.",
      ],
    },

    BENEFITS: {
      title: "Benefits of White Sapphire",
      paragraphs: [
        "In some Indian practice, white sapphire is offered as an alternative to diamond in connection with Venus or Shukra. This is not universally accepted in classical texts and remains a matter of tradition and belief.",

        "Sapphire is a variety of corundum with a Mohs hardness of 9, one of the hardest natural gemstones, and is excellent for rings and everyday wear.",

        "Astrological and metaphysical effects are matters of traditional belief and personal faith. They should not be considered guaranteed outcomes or substitutes for professional advice.",
      ],
    },

    "WHO SHOULD WEAR": {
      title: "Who Should Wear White Sapphire?",
      paragraphs: [
        "Anyone who appreciates the colour and character of White Sapphire may choose it as fine jewellery.",

        "Where a gemstone is chosen for astrological reasons, traditional practice is to have the individual birth chart examined by a qualified astrologer, since suitability can vary from person to person.",

        "For jewellery purposes, anyone who appreciates the look and character of White Sapphire may choose it without wearing it for astrological reasons.",
      ],
    },

    "HOW TO WEAR": {
      title: "How to Wear White Sapphire",
      paragraphs: [
        "White Sapphire is commonly set in rings, pendants, earrings and bracelets in gold, silver or platinum, depending on the design. A secure setting protects the stone while allowing light to reach it.",

        "For astrological use, traditional practices may specify the metal, finger, day, and method of wearing a gemstone. These recommendations vary with the individual's birth chart and astrological tradition.",

        "If you are purchasing White Sapphire specifically for astrological purposes, it is advisable to follow the guidance of a qualified practitioner rather than relying on a general recommendation.",
      ],
    },

    "QUALITY FACTORS": {
      title: "White Sapphire Quality Factors",
      paragraphs: [
        "The best stones are colourless or very nearly so, without grey, yellow or blue tints. Colour is assessed by eye and, in some cases, by laboratory report.",

        "Clarity is especially important because inclusions are more visible in a colourless stone. A precise cut is needed for good light return.",

        "Many white sapphires are heat treated to improve colour or clarity, which should be disclosed. Origin matters less than clarity and cut for most buyers.",
      ],
    },

    "CARE & CLEANING": {
      title: "White Sapphire Care & Cleaning",
      paragraphs: [
        "Sapphire is tough and suited to regular wear. Clean with lukewarm water, mild soap and a soft brush, rinse thoroughly and dry with a soft cloth. Stones that are fracture-filled or diffusion-treated need extra care, so follow the seller's guidance.",

        "When not being worn, store White Sapphire jewellery separately in a soft pouch to reduce the possibility of scratches or damage to other pieces. Periodic checks of the setting by a jeweller are also advisable.",

        "If the stone has undergone any treatment, follow the specific care recommendations provided by the seller or a gemological professional.",
      ],
    },

    "PRICE GUIDE": {
      title: "White Sapphire Price Guide",
      paragraphs: [
        "White sapphire is considerably more affordable than diamond, with prices driven by clarity, cut, size and treatment.",

        "There is no single fixed price for White Sapphire. When comparing prices, compare stones with similar characteristics, treatment status and certification.",

        "A very low price should be evaluated carefully, particularly when the gemstone is claimed to be natural, untreated, or from a specific origin.",
      ],
    },

    "BUYER BEWARE": {
      title: "White Sapphire Buyer Beware",
      paragraphs: [
        "Check that the stone is natural white sapphire and not synthetic, glass, cubic zirconia or white topaz, as lookalikes are common. A laboratory report and clear disclosure of treatment help.",

        "A reputable seller should be able to explain the gemstone's treatment status and provide appropriate documentation or certification when available.",

        "Be careful with unsupported claims about guaranteed astrological results, extremely rare origins, or unusually high value. A professional gemological report can provide useful information about identity and characteristics.",

    },

    "FAQ'S": {
      title: "Frequently Asked Questions",
      paragraphs: [
        "What is White Sapphire? White sapphire is colourless corundum prized for its hardness, clarity and bright, clean appearance in fine jewellery.",

        "Is White Sapphire associated with any planet in astrology? In some Indian practice, white sapphire is offered as an alternative to diamond in connection with Venus or Shukra. This is not universally accepted in classical texts and remains a matter of tradition and belief.",

        "Is White Sapphire durable? Sapphire is a variety of corundum with a Mohs hardness of 9, one of the hardest natural gemstones, and is excellent for rings and everyday wear.",

        "Is white sapphire a diamond? No. It is colourless corundum with different chemistry and brilliance, and it is much more affordable than diamond.",

        "Does white sapphire scratch easily? No. With a Mohs hardness of 9 it is highly resistant to scratching, though diamond is harder.",

        "How can I verify White Sapphire? A reputable gemological laboratory certificate can help identify the gemstone and provide information about characteristics such as whether it is natural or synthetic and whether treatment has been detected.",
