      title: "About Color Change Sapphire",
      paragraphs: [
        "Color Change Sapphire is corundum that changes colour with the light source, commonly from blue or bluish violet in daylight to purple or reddish purple under incandescent light. The effect is related to trace elements such as chromium and vanadium.",

        "These sapphires are found in places including Sri Lanka, Tanzania, Madagascar and Myanmar. They are different from alexandrite, which is a variety of chrysoberyl, although their behaviour can look similar.",

        "The appearance and value of Color Change Sapphire depend on several characteristics, including colour, clarity, cut, carat weight, origin, treatment, and overall quality.",
      ],
    },

    BENEFITS: {
      title: "Benefits of Color Change Sapphire",
      paragraphs: [
        "Colour change sapphires are not part of the classical Navratna. Since they are sapphires, associations vary with the colours and tradition, and should be discussed with a qualified astrologer as a matter of belief.",

        "Sapphire is a variety of corundum with a Mohs hardness of 9, one of the hardest natural gemstones, and is excellent for rings and everyday wear.",

        "Astrological and metaphysical effects are matters of traditional belief and personal faith. They should not be considered guaranteed outcomes or substitutes for professional advice.",
      ],
    },

    "WHO SHOULD WEAR": {
      title: "Who Should Wear Color Change Sapphire?",
      paragraphs: [
        "Anyone who appreciates the colour and character of Color Change Sapphire may choose it as fine jewellery.",

        "Where a gemstone is chosen for astrological reasons, traditional practice is to have the individual birth chart examined by a qualified astrologer, since suitability can vary from person to person.",

        "For jewellery purposes, anyone who appreciates the look and character of Color Change Sapphire may choose it without wearing it for astrological reasons.",
      ],
    },

    "HOW TO WEAR": {
      title: "How to Wear Color Change Sapphire",
      paragraphs: [
        "Color Change Sapphire is commonly set in rings, pendants, earrings and bracelets in gold, silver or platinum, depending on the design. A secure setting protects the stone while allowing light to reach it.",

        "For astrological use, traditional practices may specify the metal, finger, day, and method of wearing a gemstone. These recommendations vary with the individual's birth chart and astrological tradition.",

        "If you are purchasing Color Change Sapphire specifically for astrological purposes, it is advisable to follow the guidance of a qualified practitioner rather than relying on a general recommendation.",
      ],
    },

    "QUALITY FACTORS": {
      title: "Color Change Sapphire Quality Factors",
      paragraphs: [
        "A distinct, noticeable colour change between two attractive hues is the main value factor. The stronger and more complete the change, the better.",

        "Clarity and cut are judged as for other sapphires, with the cut also needing to let the change be seen. Larger stones with good clarity are scarce.",

        "Heat treatment is widely used on sapphire and accepted in the trade when disclosed. Unheated stones, notable origin and larger carat weight can substantially raise value.",
      ],
    },

    "CARE & CLEANING": {
      title: "Color Change Sapphire Care & Cleaning",
      paragraphs: [
        "Sapphire is tough and suited to regular wear. Clean with lukewarm water, mild soap and a soft brush, rinse thoroughly and dry with a soft cloth. Stones that are fracture-filled or diffusion-treated need extra care, so follow the seller's guidance.",

        "When not being worn, store Color Change Sapphire jewellery separately in a soft pouch to reduce the possibility of scratches or damage to other pieces. Periodic checks of the setting by a jeweller are also advisable.",

        "If the stone has undergone any treatment, follow the specific care recommendations provided by the seller or a gemological professional.",
      ],
    },

    "PRICE GUIDE": {
      title: "Color Change Sapphire Price Guide",
      paragraphs: [
        "Prices rise with strength of colour change, size and clarity, and fine stones are significantly more valuable than simple blue or purple sapphires of similar size.",

        "There is no single fixed price for Color Change Sapphire. When comparing prices, compare stones with similar characteristics, treatment status and certification.",

        "A very low price should be evaluated carefully, particularly when the gemstone is claimed to be natural, untreated, or from a specific origin.",
      ],
    },

    "BUYER BEWARE": {
      title: "Color Change Sapphire Buyer Beware",
      paragraphs: [
        "Synthetic colour-change corundum, often sold as synthetic alexandrite, is widespread. Confirm that the stone is natural corundum with a laboratory report, and that it is not mislabelled as alexandrite.",

        "A reputable seller should be able to explain the gemstone's treatment status and provide appropriate documentation or certification when available.",

        "Be careful with unsupported claims about guaranteed astrological results, extremely rare origins, or unusually high value. A professional gemological report can provide useful information about identity and characteristics.",
      ],

    "FAQ'S": {
      title: "Frequently Asked Questions",
      paragraphs: [
        "What is Color Change Sapphire? Colour change sapphires shift between hues, such as blue in daylight and purple under incandescent light.",

        "Is Color Change Sapphire associated with any planet in astrology? Colour change sapphires are not part of the classical Navratna. Since they are sapphires, associations vary with the colours and tradition, and should be discussed with a qualified astrologer as a matter of belief.",

        "Is Color Change Sapphire durable? Sapphire is a variety of corundum with a Mohs hardness of 9, one of the hardest natural gemstones, and is excellent for rings and everyday wear.",

        "Is Color Change Sapphire the same as Alexandrite? No. Colour change sapphire is corundum, while alexandrite is chrysoberyl. They are different gemstones even though both can change colour.",

        "What causes the colour change? The stone's trace-element colourants absorb different wavelengths, so it looks different under daylight and under incandescent light.",

        "How can I verify Color Change Sapphire? A reputable gemological laboratory certificate can help identify the gemstone and provide information about characteristics such as whether it is natural or synthetic and whether treatment has been detected.",
