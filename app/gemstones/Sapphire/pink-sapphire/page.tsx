      paragraphs: [
        "Pink Sapphire is the pink variety of corundum, coloured mainly by chromium. When the colour is deep and strongly red, the stone may be classed as ruby, and the boundary between pink sapphire and ruby can vary by laboratory.",

        "Sources include Sri Lanka, Madagascar, Tanzania and Myanmar, among others. Colours range from pale pink to intense raspberry and hot pink.",

        "The appearance and value of Pink Sapphire depend on several characteristics, including colour, clarity, cut, carat weight, origin, treatment, and overall quality.",
      ],
    },

    BENEFITS: {
      title: "Benefits of Pink Sapphire",
      paragraphs: [
        "Pink Sapphire is not a classical Navratna gemstone. Astrological associations vary between practitioners and are a matter of tradition and belief, so individual guidance from a qualified astrologer is advisable.",

        "Sapphire is a variety of corundum with a Mohs hardness of 9, one of the hardest natural gemstones, and is excellent for rings and everyday wear.",

        "Astrological and metaphysical effects are matters of traditional belief and personal faith. They should not be considered guaranteed outcomes or substitutes for professional advice.",
      ],
    },

    "WHO SHOULD WEAR": {
      title: "Who Should Wear Pink Sapphire?",
      paragraphs: [
        "Anyone who appreciates the colour and character of Pink Sapphire may choose it as fine jewellery.",

        "Where a gemstone is chosen for astrological reasons, traditional practice is to have the individual birth chart examined by a qualified astrologer, since suitability can vary from person to person.",

        "For jewellery purposes, anyone who appreciates the look and character of Pink Sapphire may choose it without wearing it for astrological reasons.",
      ],
    },

    "HOW TO WEAR": {
      title: "How to Wear Pink Sapphire",
      paragraphs: [
        "Pink Sapphire is commonly set in rings, pendants, earrings and bracelets in gold, silver or platinum, depending on the design. A secure setting protects the stone while allowing light to reach it.",

        "For astrological use, traditional practices may specify the metal, finger, day, and method of wearing a gemstone. These recommendations vary with the individual's birth chart and astrological tradition.",

        "If you are purchasing Pink Sapphire specifically for astrological purposes, it is advisable to follow the guidance of a qualified practitioner rather than relying on a general recommendation.",
      ],
    },

    "QUALITY FACTORS": {
      title: "Pink Sapphire Quality Factors",
      paragraphs: [
        "Vivid, clean, evenly saturated pink without excessive brown or grey is most valued. Very intense stones are particularly sought after.",

        "Natural sapphire commonly contains some inclusions, and eye-clean stones are more valuable. A well-proportioned cut that returns light evenly is important for brilliance.",

        "Heat treatment is widely used on sapphire and accepted in the trade when disclosed. Unheated stones, notable origin and larger carat weight can substantially raise value.",
      ],
    },

    "CARE & CLEANING": {
      title: "Pink Sapphire Care & Cleaning",
      paragraphs: [
        "Sapphire is tough and suited to regular wear. Clean with lukewarm water, mild soap and a soft brush, rinse thoroughly and dry with a soft cloth. Stones that are fracture-filled or diffusion-treated need extra care, so follow the seller's guidance.",

        "When not being worn, store Pink Sapphire jewellery separately in a soft pouch to reduce the possibility of scratches or damage to other pieces. Periodic checks of the setting by a jeweller are also advisable.",

        "If the stone has undergone any treatment, follow the specific care recommendations provided by the seller or a gemological professional.",
      ],
    },

    "PRICE GUIDE": {
      title: "Pink Sapphire Price Guide",
      paragraphs: [
        "Prices vary with colour intensity, clarity, size, origin and treatment. Vivid, clean stones that are unheated command premiums over pale or heavily included stones.",

        "There is no single fixed price for Pink Sapphire. When comparing prices, compare stones with similar characteristics, treatment status and certification.",

        "A very low price should be evaluated carefully, particularly when the gemstone is claimed to be natural, untreated, or from a specific origin.",
      ],
    },

    "BUYER BEWARE": {
      title: "Pink Sapphire Buyer Beware",
      paragraphs: [
        "Check that the stone is natural sapphire rather than glass, synthetic or dyed material, and ask about heating or other treatments. For deeper stones, ask whether the laboratory would classify it as pink sapphire or ruby.",

        "A reputable seller should be able to explain the gemstone's treatment status and provide appropriate documentation or certification when available.",

        "Be careful with unsupported claims about guaranteed astrological results, extremely rare origins, or unusually high value. A professional gemological report can provide useful information about identity and characteristics.",

    "FAQ'S": {
      title: "Frequently Asked Questions",
      paragraphs: [
        "What is Pink Sapphire? Pink sapphire is corundum in shades from soft pastel to vivid hot pink and combines romantic colour with exceptional hardness.",

        "Is Pink Sapphire associated with any planet in astrology? Pink Sapphire is not a classical Navratna gemstone. Astrological associations vary between practitioners and are a matter of tradition and belief, so individual guidance from a qualified astrologer is advisable.",

        "Is Pink Sapphire durable? Sapphire is a variety of corundum with a Mohs hardness of 9, one of the hardest natural gemstones, and is excellent for rings and everyday wear.",

        "When does pink sapphire become ruby? There is no single global line. Laboratories use colour criteria to decide, and classification can differ, so check the wording on the report.",

        "Is heat treatment common in pink sapphire? Yes. Many pink sapphires are heated to improve colour and clarity, and treatment should be disclosed.",

        "How can I verify Pink Sapphire? A reputable gemological laboratory certificate can help identify the gemstone and provide information about characteristics such as whether it is natural or synthetic and whether treatment has been detected.",
